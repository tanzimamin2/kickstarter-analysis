# Kickstarter Analysis
This report is an analysis into Kickstarter campaigns, our client Louise wants to know how different campaigns performed in relation to their **launch dates and their funding goals**.

We have collected a diverse dataset which contains information on multiple Kickstarter campaigns across various categories and countries. This report will get into further details of our findings.

## Overview of Project
Louis is mainly interested in campaigns that are funding plays, specifically in these two areas-
* How the launch date relates to a campaigns outcome?
* How the funding goal relates to a campaigns outcome?

### Purpose
The main purpose of this report is to analyze the dataset and answer the two questions mentioned above. This will help Louise make an informed decision as to ***when she should launch her campaign***. As well as ***what should be a realistic funding goal***. 

## Analysis and Challenges
Lets take a closer look at the analysis and our findings.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Our dataset is very diverse and includes several categories like games, technology and many others. But for our report we filtered the data and narrowed it down to what is relevant to our client.
* Only selected the theater category
* Divided the outcomes into Successful, Failed and Canceled
* Grouped the data according to the month, so its easier to visualize (The data is taken from 2009 to 2017)
* Plotted a line chart to better communicate our findings
