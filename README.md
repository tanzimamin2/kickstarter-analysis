# Kickstarter Analysis
This report is an analysis into Kickstarter campaigns, our client Louise wants to know how different campaigns performed in relation to their **launch dates and their funding goals**.

We have collected a diverse dataset which contains information on multiple Kickstarter campaigns across various categories and countries. This report will get into further details of our findings.

## Overview of Project
Louis is mainly interested in campaigns that are funding plays, specifically in these two areas-
* How the launch date relates to a campaigns outcome?
* How the funding goal relates to a campaigns outcome?

### Purpose
The main purpose of this report is to analyze the dataset and answer the two questions mentioned above. This will help Louise make an informed decision as to ***when she should launch her campaign***. As well as ***what should be a realistic funding goal***.
